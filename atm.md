Automated teller machines (ATMs) allow you to perform basic banking functions on-the-go without interacting with a bank teller or needing to visit a branch. (?) 

Note that not every ATM performs every function, but they all let you withdraw cash.

ATMs usually have the following physical components:
Keypad
Screen
Card slot 
Cash/check slot
Receipt printer

## Considerations
Safety: Watch out for people stealing your info or moneys.
Fees: You will likely get charged fees if you don’t use your own bank’s ATM, although some banks reimburse fees. 

## Requirements
To use an ATM, you’ll need the following:

- Banking card: The debit card linked to your bank account. You can also use a credit card, but it might cost you more money. See above. 
- Personal identification number (PIN): To use the ATM, you’ll need a PIN to access the account linked to your debit card. If you aren’t sure what your PIN is, contact your bank using the number on the back of your debit card.



1. Insert your card into the slot. Look at the picture if you’re not sure which way.
2. Choose and confirm a language by tapping on the screen.
3. Accept the fees?
4. Choose a function:
    - Withdraw
        - Max 200 usually
    - Checking or savings
    - View account balance
    - Deposit
    - Transfer

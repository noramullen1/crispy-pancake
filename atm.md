Automated teller machines (ATMs) allow you to perform basic banking functions without visiting a bank branch. Using an ATM offers the following conveniences:
- Multiple locations, typically far more than bank branch locations
- Open 24 hours a day
- Often faster than interacting with a teller

Note that not every ATM performs every function, but they all let you withdraw cash.

## Considerations
- **Safety**: Always be aware of your surroundings when using an ATM. Make sure that no one can see you enter your PIN (learn more about PINs [below](#pin)). 
- **Fees**: If you use an ATM outside of your bank's network, you will likely be charged a fee by both your bank and the ATM operator. The average out-of-network ATM fee is $4.59 (bankrate.com/banking/how-much-are-atm-fees/). 
- **Limitations on cash**: Many ATMs have cash withdrawal limits, usually ranging from $200 to $1000. 

## Overview

ATMs usually have the following physical components:
- **A. Screen**: The screen displays options and instructions for using the ATM. For many modern ATMs, you can interact via touchscreen, but some have buttons along the side of the screen instead.
- **B. Keypad**: Use the keypad to enter your PIN (see pin section below).
- **C. Card slot**: The card slot is where you insert your banking card.  
- **D. Cash slot**: This slot dispenses cash and sometimes also receives deposits. 
- **E. Receipt printer**: Prints the receipts lol.

Automated teller machines (ATMs) allow you to perform basic banking functions, such as withdrawals, transfers, and deposits, without visiting a bank branch. Using an ATM can offer the following conveniences:
- Multiple locations, typically far more than bank branch locations
- Open 24 hours a day
- Faster than interacting with a teller

## Considerations
- **Safety**: Always be aware of your surroundings when using an ATM. Make sure that no one can see you enter your PIN (learn more about PINs [below](#pin)). 
- **Fees**: If you use an ATM outside of your bank's network, you will likely be charged a fee by both your bank and the ATM operator. The average out-of-network ATM fee is $4.59.
- **Limitations on cash**: Many ATMs have cash withdrawal limits, usually ranging from $200 to $1000. 

## Requirements
To use an ATM, you’ll need the following:
- **Banking card**: The debit card linked to your bank account. You can also use a credit card, but your bank will likely charge you a high interest rate. 
- <a name="pin">**Personal identification number (PIN)**</a>: To use the ATM, you’ll need a PIN to access the account linked to your banking card. If you aren’t sure what your PIN is, contact your bank using the number on the back of your banking card.
